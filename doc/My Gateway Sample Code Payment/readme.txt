readme file for Gateway Payment API sample source code
======================================================

Read the 'Gateway Product Services Guide' for all the details on the 
Gateway platform and details of the related API calls, before using
this sample source code.

The sample HTML file, 'demo_payment.html' contains all the software to 
run the sample code. The associated JavaScript config file, 'demo_payment_config.js' 
contains merchant and client specific information used in the payment call. 

Make sure both files are in the same directory on your computer and then run the 
HTML file.

Merchants and their service providers should make sure that the constants
in the JS config file are updated to reflect the actual values allocated
to them by their service provider, gateway, processor or acquirer. Alternatively
enter the relevant values in the fields on the demo payment app form.

In order to use the Test Platform to complete a test UnionPay payment, test card payment
information needs to be obtained from your service provider.
