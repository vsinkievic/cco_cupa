You are an expert in Java programming, Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Maven, JUnit, Vaadin and related Java technologies.

Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented Java code with accurate Spring Boot examples.
- Use Spring Boot best practices and conventions throughout your code.
- Implement RESTful API design patterns when creating web services.
- Use descriptive method and variable names following camelCase convention.
- Adhere to the package-by-feature architecture (ui, application, domain, infrastructure) as defined in the project's Architecture.md.

Spring Boot Specifics
- Use Spring Boot starters for quick project setup and dependency management.
- Implement proper use of annotations (e.g., @SpringBootApplication, @RestController, @Service).
- Utilize Spring Boot's auto-configuration features effectively.
- Implement proper exception handling using @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler.

Vaadin specifics
 - Use Vaadin Flow recommended architecture and best practices

JHipster Specifics
- JHipster is a legacy, but it will be included for a long time, it came with a specific project setup and dependencies.
- Use "./mvnw package" for dev profile - to compile and test without Integration Tests
- Use "./mvnw -Pprod install" with prod profile to compile and test with Integration tests.
- Use ./runIntegrationTest.sh to execute particular test. Check execution manual inside the script.
- Application many settings from the JHipster. Read JHipster documentation in docs/JHipster-documentation.md

Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., UserController, OrderService).
- Use camelCase for method and variable names (e.g., findUserById, isOrderValid).
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants (e.g., MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS, DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE).

Java and Spring Boot Usage
- Use Java 17 or later features when applicable (e.g., records, sealed classes, pattern matching).
- Leverage Spring Boot 3.x features and best practices.
- Use Spring Data JPA for database operations when applicable.
- Implement proper validation using Bean Validation (e.g., @Valid, custom validators).

Configuration and Properties
- Use application.properties or application.yml for configuration.
- Implement environment-specific configurations using Spring Profiles.
- Use @ConfigurationProperties for type-safe configuration properties.

Dependency Injection and IoC
- Use constructor injection over field injection for better testability.
- Leverage Spring's IoC container for managing bean lifecycles.

Testing
- Write unit tests using JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test.
- Use MockMvc for testing web layers.
- Implement integration tests using @SpringBootTest.
- Use @DataJpaTest for repository layer tests.

Performance and Scalability
- Implement caching strategies using Spring Cache abstraction.
- Use async processing with @Async for non-blocking operations.
- Implement proper database indexing and query optimization.

Security
- Implement Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- Use proper password encoding (e.g., BCrypt).
- Implement CORS configuration when necessary.

Logging and Monitoring
- Use SLF4J with Logback for logging.
- Implement proper log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG).
- Use Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring and metrics.

API Documentation
- Use Springdoc OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) for API documentation.

Data Access and ORM
- Use Spring Data JPA for database operations.
- Implement proper entity relationships and cascading.
- Use database migrations with tools like Flyway or Liquibase.

Build and Deployment
- Use Maven for dependency management and build processes.
- Implement proper profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod).
- Use Docker for containerization if applicable.

Follow best practices for:
- RESTful API design (proper use of HTTP methods, status codes, etc.).
- Microservices architecture (if applicable).
- Asynchronous processing using Spring's @Async or reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.

Adhere to SOLID principles and maintain high cohesion and low coupling in your Spring Boot application design.
